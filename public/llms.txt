# Applied Longevity

> Private longevity advisory — evidence-based, 1-on-1 guidance for a small number of clients.

## What is Applied Longevity?

Applied Longevity is a private longevity advisory working with only 3–5 clients at a time, for a minimum of 6 months each. Every engagement begins with a 4-week observation period — no changes, just data collection. From there, a protocol is built around each client's life.

This is not a quick fix. This is not a group program. This is focused, evidence-based, 1-on-1 guidance.

## The Five Pillars

Our coaching framework is built on five integrated pillars:

1. **Training** — Strength, cardiovascular fitness, mobility, and recovery programmed as one integrated system. Periodized strength, Zone 2/VO2max cardio, mobility assessments, and recovery load management.

2. **Nutrition** — Data-informed approach to nutrition. We track biomarkers, body composition, and energy to find the right dietary pattern. Includes macronutrient analysis, meal timing, continuous glucose monitoring, and periodic dietary experiments.

3. **Sleep** — The single highest-leverage variable for health and performance. We optimize sleep architecture using wearable data — not just duration, but quality and consistency of each stage. Circadian rhythm alignment, environment optimization, and behavioral interventions.

4. **Emotional Health** — Stress, relationships, purpose, and psychological resilience are foundational to physical health. We address stress management, mindfulness, social connection, values alignment, and life design.

5. **Medical & Metrics** — We work with your medical team to track biomarkers that matter. Quarterly comprehensive blood panels, cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers, hormonal profiles, DEXA, coronary calcium, and other imaging.

## How It Works

Every engagement follows a three-phase structure:

- **Phase 1: Observe (Weeks 1–4)** — We collect baseline data on sleep, training, nutrition, bloodwork, and well-being. No changes yet.
- **Phase 2: Build (Weeks 5–16)** — We introduce changes one layer at a time across all five pillars, tracking and measuring each intervention.
- **Phase 3: Consolidate (Ongoing)** — Maintenance and optimization with regular check-ins, re-testing, and seasonal adjustments.
