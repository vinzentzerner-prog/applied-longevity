# Applied Longevity — Complete Reference

> Private longevity advisory — evidence-based, 1-on-1 guidance for 3–5 clients at a time.

## Overview

Applied Longevity is a private longevity advisory specializing in long-term health optimization. Unlike typical coaching programs, it operates on a deliberately limited model: only 3–5 clients at any time, each with a minimum 6-month commitment. The approach is evidence-based, data-driven, and built on an analytical framework borrowed from alternative investment analysis — thinking in decades, managing complexity across multiple variables, and compounding small gains over time.

## The Five Pillars Framework

Applied Longevity's coaching protocol is built on five integrated pillars that are addressed both individually and as a unified system:

### 1. Training
Strength, cardiovascular fitness, mobility, and recovery — programmed as one integrated system.
- Periodized strength programming
- Zone 2 and VO2max cardiovascular work
- Mobility and movement quality assessments
- Recovery load management
- Designed around the client's schedule, injury history, and long-term structural goals
- Goal: build a body that performs well at 40, 60, and beyond

### 2. Nutrition
Data-informed approach — no ideology, no fads.
- Macronutrient and micronutrient analysis
- Meal timing and composition strategies
- Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) integration
- Periodic dietary experiments and reviews
- Tracks biomarkers, body composition, and subjective energy
- Finds the dietary pattern that supports training, cognitive performance, and metabolic health

### 3. Sleep
The single highest-leverage variable for health and performance.
- Sleep environment optimization
- Circadian rhythm alignment
- Wearable data interpretation (deep sleep, REM, latency)
- Behavioral and supplemental interventions
- Optimizes sleep architecture — not just duration, but quality and consistency of each stage

### 4. Emotional Health
Stress, relationships, purpose, and psychological resilience are foundational to physical health.
- Stress load assessment and management
- Mindfulness and contemplative practices
- Social connection and relationship quality
- Values alignment and life design
- Addressed with the same rigor applied to training and nutrition

### 5. Medical & Metrics
Objective tracking working alongside the client's medical team.
- Quarterly comprehensive blood panels
- Cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers
- Hormonal and inflammatory profiles
- DEXA, coronary calcium, and other imaging
- Longitudinal tracking shows how the body responds to the protocol

## Three-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Observe (Weeks 1–4)
No changes are made. For four weeks, baseline data is collected:
- Sleep architecture
- Training logs
- Nutrition patterns
- Bloodwork
- Subjective well-being
This creates a clear picture before touching any variables.

### Phase 2: Build (Weeks 5–16)
With a solid baseline, changes are introduced one layer at a time across all five pillars. Each intervention is tracked and measured. Changes are stacked only when the previous layer has stabilized.

### Phase 3: Consolidate (Ongoing)
Once the core protocol is in place, the focus shifts to maintenance and optimization:
- Regular check-ins
- Periodic re-testing
- Seasonal adjustments
This keeps clients progressing without burnout.

## Founder Background

The founder combines an unconventional mix of credentials:

**CAIA — Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst**
One of the most rigorous designations in finance. Trains disciplined thinking about long-horizon portfolios, risk management, and filtering evidence from noise. Applied directly to health optimization — treating the body as a long-duration asset that compounds or deteriorates based on how it's managed.

**Psychology & Management**
Behavior change is the hardest part of any health protocol. Understanding motivation, habit formation, and how people relate to systems over time is what separates coaching that lasts from programs that expire at week twelve.

**Certified Personal Trainer**
Formal validation of fifteen years of lived experience. Programming, movement mechanics, load management — done correctly and with precision.

**Certified Nutrition Coach**
Evidence-based approach to nutrition. No dogma, no tribal nutrition wars. Years of personal experimentation provide a real-world lens to stress-test theory against practice.

## Philosophy — Four Core Principles

1. **Observe before you act** — Every engagement starts with four weeks of baseline data collection. No changes until the current state is clearly understood.

2. **Small roster, deep work** — 3–5 clients at a time, minimum six months each. Not scalable by design. Real guidance requires real attention.

3. **Evidence over ideology** — No fads, no miracle supplements. Track what actually changes via bloodwork, wearables, and fitness benchmarks — and adjust accordingly.

4. **Stability as the strategy** — The goal is a protocol maintained for decades, not a 12-week transformation. Build habits and systems that compound like good long-term investments.

## Application Process

1. **Submit application** — Brief form covering goals, current health status, and expectations.
2. **Introductory call** — 30-minute call if there's a good fit.
3. **Onboarding & baseline** — Access to tracking tools and the 4-week observation phase.

Response time: typically 5–7 business days. If at capacity, applicants are added to the waitlist.
