What began as helping friends improve performance turned into a deep interest in building strength, endurance, and health that lasts.\n\nToday I work with only 3–5 clients at a time for a minimum of six months. We begin with four weeks of baseline monitoring to understand your current habits, constraints, and stressors—so the plan is sustainable from day one. From there, we build an individualized strategy across training, nutrition, sleep, and recovery, and track progress with objective metrics (e.g., VO₂ max, fitness benchmarks, and wearable data) plus regular check-ins."
